## How to embed into articles \(oEmbed/iframely\)

If you are using a publishing system where you can embed a YouTube video or a Instagram picture by pasting in the link, there's a good chance that you can just paste in following and the widget will embed automatically.

```text
https://widget.vaxx.nz
```

The Vaxx.nz widget complies with the [oEmbed](https://oembed.com/) specification. Most media companies in New Zealand use a third party tool called [iframely](https://iframely.com/) built into their publishing systems to deliver embeds using the oEmbed specification. The Vaxx.nz widget is fully compatible and is whitelisted by iframely.
